        "The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Encapsulation: This principle involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which helps to protect the object's integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. It allows programmers to define interfaces and abstract classes, enabling the creation of complex systems while reducing complexity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Inheritance: This concept allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, even if they are actually instances of derived classes. This allows for methods to be defined in multiple forms, supporting method overriding and overloading.\n",
        "\n",
        "Composition: Although sometimes considered part of encapsulation, composition is the principle of building complex types by combining objects (components). It emphasizes creating relationships between objects, allowing for greater flexibility and reusability.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts work together to create modular, maintainable, and scalable code in OOP."
